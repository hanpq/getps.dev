## Overview

**DKIM** (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is an email authentication method that allows an organization to claim responsibility for a message by affixing a digital signature to it. The recipient's email server can then verify that the signature matches the message and that it was sent by an authorized sender, helping ensure the email has not been altered during transit. DKIM's goal is to prevent email spoofing and ensure message integrity.

## Workflow

1. The **sending system** takes specific parts of the email (typically the headers and sometimes the body) and generates a cryptographic hash, which represents the email content.
2. This hash is encrypted using the domain's private key and appended as the DKIM signature to the email's headers.
3. The DKIM signature contains metadata, such as which header fields were included in the hash and a reference to the DKIM DNS record for verification.
4. When the email arrives at the recipient's system, the receiving mail server:
   * Extracts the DKIM signature from the headers.
   * Looks up the DKIM public key in the DNS using the domain and selector specified in the signature.
   * Decrypts the signature with the public key, retrieving the original hash.
   * Recomputes the hash using the received email's header and body.
   * Compares the two hashes. If they match, the email passes DKIM validation, confirming that it wasn't altered in transit and that it was authorized by the signing domain.

## Pros

* **Email Authenticity**: DKIM confirms that the email was sent from a domain that has authorized the sender, enhancing trust.
* **Message Integrity**: DKIM ensures that the email's content (headers and optionally the body) hasn't been modified after it was signed by the sending server.
* **Widely Supported**: DKIM is widely adopted and supported by major email providers, including Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo.
* **Plays well with DMARC**: When used in conjunction with **DMARC**, DKIM helps establish a domain's email authentication policy, ensuring that spoofed messages are more likely to be rejected.

## Cons

* **Does not protect "MAIL FROM"**: DKIM does not authenticate the "MAIL FROM" (envelope sender) address, which is often displayed in email clients. Spoofers can still manipulate this value to mislead recipients.
* **Forwarding Issues**: Forwarded messages may cause DKIM verification to fail. This occurs because forwarding servers often modify parts of the email, such as headers or the body, that were included in the DKIM signature.
* **Key Management**: Administrators must manage DKIM keys securely, rotating them periodically to prevent compromise.
* **Requires DNS**: DKIM relies heavily on DNS infrastructure for the public key, meaning disruptions in DNS can lead to authentication issues.

## Details

### DNS Record

The DKIM DNS record is a TXT record published by the domain owner in the DNS zone file. This record contains the public key that receiving mail servers use to verify the DKIM signature.

#### DNS Record Name

`[selector]._domainkey.[domain].[topdomain]`

* **Selector**: A label (usually a short string) defined by the domain owner, used to differentiate multiple DKIM keys for the same domain.
* **Domain**: The sender's domain (e.g., [example.com](http://example.com)).
* **Top Domain**: The top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org).

#### Example Value

`v=DKIM1; p=[yourPublicKey]`

### Mandatory Tags

| **Tag** | **Description**                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `v`     | The version of the DKIM record. This must be `DKIM1` and should appear as the first tag.       |
| `p`     | The public key. This is the key used by receiving mail servers to validate the DKIM signature. |

### Recommended Tags

| **Tag** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `t`     | **Testing Mode**: `t=y` indicates that the domain is testing DKIM. When testing is complete, this tag should be removed or changed to `t=s` to enforce DKIM signatures. |
| `t=s`   | **Strict Matching**: If the `i=` tag in the DKIM signature is used, this enforces that the "i=" domain must match the "d=" domain exactly, without allowing subdomains. |

### Optional Tags

| **Tag** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `g`     | **Granularity**: Defines which local-part of an email address (before the `@` sign) can use the key. A wildcard `*` allows all users in the domain to use the selector. |
| `h`     | **Hash Algorithms**: Specifies which hash algorithms are acceptable (`sha1`, `sha256`). DKIM requires that both the sender and the verifier support `sha256`.           |
| `k`     | **Key Type**: Specifies the key algorithm (default: `RSA`).                                                                                                             |
| `n`     | **Notes**: For administrative use, this can contain a human-readable note for admins. It does not impact DKIM functionality.                                            |
| `s`     | **Service Type**: Defines the service type the record applies to (e.g., `email`). By default, this applies to all service types (`*`).                                  |

### Long DNS Records

When the DKIM public key is too long (which is common for 2048-bit keys), the DNS TXT record may exceed the 255-character limit. To solve this, the key can be split into multiple quoted strings in a single DNS TXT record.

Example:

```javascript
"p=string_part1"
"string_part2"
"string_part3"
```

### DKIM Signature

The DKIM signature is added as an email header when the message is sent. This signature contains metadata about the signature process and the cryptographic signature itself.

#### Example Value

`DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=example.net; s=brisbane; c=relaxed/simple; q=dns/txt; l=1234; t=1117574938; x=1118006938; h=from:to:subject; bh=MTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODkwMTI=; b=dzdVyOfAKCdLXdJOc9G2q8LoXSlEniSbav+yuU4zGeeruD00lszZVoG4ZHRNiYzR`

### Tags in the DKIM Signature

| `c`     | Canonicalization algorithms for the header and body. These determine how the email is normalized before signing. Common values are `relaxed/relaxed` and `relaxed/simple`. |
| `q`     | Query method (usually `dns/txt` to retrieve the public key).                                                                                                               |
| `l`     | Length of the canonicalized body that was signed.                                                                                                                          |

| `bh`    | The hash of the canonicalized body. This is used to verify that the body has not been altered.                                                                             |

### Canonicalization Algorithms

The canonicalization process normalizes the email's header and body content before hashing and signing, ensuring that insignificant changes (like extra whitespace) don't break DKIM verification. The two common methods are:

1. **relaxed**: Reduces whitespace and normalizes header field names, making the signature more resilient to minor changes.
2. **simple**: Requires an exact match of the header and body, making it more prone to failure if even minor modifications occur (e.g., forwarding or adding extra headers).

### Interplay with SPF and DMARC

While DKIM verifies the integrity and authenticity of an email, it does not authenticate the sending server's IP address, as **SPF** (Sender Policy Framework) does. **DMARC** (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) combines DKIM and SPF, allowing domain owners to set policies for how emails that fail authentication checks should be handled (e.g., reject, quarantine, or accept).
