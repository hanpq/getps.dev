I’ve summarized a table with all versions released of Exchange Server that shows version numbers, release date, .net requirement, OS requirement, forest functional level etc in a simple to use excel spreadsheet.

I’ll try to keep the file updated as often as I can, but if you got data you want to add please send me a message.
