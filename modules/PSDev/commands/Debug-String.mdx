## SYNOPSIS

Outputs a string in diagnostic form or as source code.

## SYNTAX

### Standard (Default)

```powershell
Debug-String [-InputObject] <Object[]> [-Delimiters <String[]>] [-NoSpacesAsDots] [-NoEmphasis] [-SingleLine]
 [-UnicodeEscapes] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### AsSourceCode

```powershell
Debug-String [-InputObject] <Object[]> [-AsSourceCode] [-SingleLine] [-UnicodeEscapes] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Caret

```powershell
Debug-String [-InputObject] <Object[]> [-Delimiters <String[]>] [-CaretNotation] [-NoSpacesAsDots]
 [-NoEmphasis] [-UnicodeEscapes] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Prints a string with control or hidden characters visualized, and optionally
all non-ASCII-range Unicode characters represented as escape sequences.

With -AsSourceCode, the result is printed in single-line form as a
double-quoted PowerShell string literal that is reusable as source code,

Common control characters are visualized using PowerShell's own escaping
notation by default, such as
"`t" for a tab, "`r" for a CR, but a LF is visualized as itself, as an
actual newline, unless you specify -SingleLine.

As an alternative, if you want ASCII-range control characters visualized in caret notation
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_notation), similar to cat -A on Linux,
use -CaretNotation.
E.g., ^M then represents a CR; but note that a LF is
always represented as "$" followed by an actual newline.

Any other control characters as well as otherwise hidden characters or
format / punctuation characters in the non-ASCII range are represented in
`u{hex-code-point} notation.

To print space characters as themselves, use -NoSpacesAsDots.

$null inputs are accepted, but a warning is issued.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
"a`ab`t c`0d`r`n" | Debug-String -Delimiters [, ]
[a`0b`t·c`0d`r`
]
```

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
"a`ab`t c`0d`r`n" | Debug-String -CaretNotation
a^Gb^I c^@d^M$
```

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
"a-ü`u{2028}" | Debug-String -UnicodeEscapes # The dash is an em-dash (U+2014)
a·`u{2014}·`u{fc}
```

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
"a`ab`t c`0d`r`n" | Debug-String -AsSourceCode -SingleLine # roundtrip
"a`ab`t c`0d`r`n"
```

## PARAMETERS

### -InputObject

Defines the string to analyze

```yaml
Type: Object[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Delimiters

You may optionally specify delimiters that the visualization of each input string is enclosed
in as a a whole its boundaries.
You may specify a single string or a 2-element array.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: Standard, Caret
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CaretNotation

Causes LF to be visualized as "$" and all other ASCII-range control characters
in caret notation, similar to `cat -A` on Linux.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Caret
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NoSpacesAsDots

By default, space chars.
are visualized as "·", the MIDDLE DOT char.
(U+00B7)

Use this switch to represent spaces as themselves.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Standard, Caret
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NoEmphasis

By default, those characters (other than spaces) that aren't output as themselves,
i.e.
control characters and, if requested with -UnicodeEscapes, non-ASCII-range characters,
are highlighted by color inversion, using ANSI (VT) escape sequences.

Use this switch to turn off this highlighting.

Note that if $PSStyle.OutputRendering = 'PlainText' is in effect, the highlighting
isn't *shown* even *without* -NoEmphasis, but the escape sequences are still part
of the output string.
Only -NoEmphasis prevents inclusion of these escape sequences.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Standard, Caret
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AsSourceCode

Outputs each input string as a double-quoted PowerShell string
that is reusable in source code, with embedded double quotes, backticks,
and "$" signs backtick-escaped.

Use -SingleLine to get a single-line representation.
Control characters that have no native PS escape sequence are represented
using `u{\<hex-code-point} notation, which will only work in PowerShell *Core*
(v6+) source code.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: AsSourceCode
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SingleLine

Requests a single-line representation, where LF characters are represented
as `n instead of actual line breaks.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Standard, AsSourceCode
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UnicodeEscapes

Requests that all non-ASCII-range characters - such as accented letters -  in
the input string be represented as Unicode escape sequences in the form
`u{hex-code-point}.

Whe cominbed with -AsSourceCode, the result is a PowerShell string literal
composed of ASCII-range characters only, but note that only PowerShell *Core*
(v6+) understands such Unicode escapes.

By default, only control characters that don't have a native PS escape
sequence / cannot be represented with caret notation are represented this way.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
