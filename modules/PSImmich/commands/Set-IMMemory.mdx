## SYNOPSIS

Updates an existing Immich memory configuration.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Set-IMMemory [[-Session] <ImmichSession>] [-Id] <String[]> [[-IsSaved] <Boolean>] [[-MemoryAt] <DateTime>]
 [[-SeenAt] <DateTime>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The Set-IMMemory function modifies the properties of an existing memory in Immich.
You can update the memory's anchor date, tracking information, and saved status.
This function supports pipeline input for batch operations and includes confirmation
prompts for safety when making changes to memory configurations.

Memories are curated collections that help users rediscover their photos, and
updating their properties can improve the user experience and memory organization.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Set-IMMemory -Id 'bf973405-3f2a-48d2-a687-2ed4167164be' -IsSaved $true
```

Marks the specified memory as saved for future reference.

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
Set-IMMemory -Id 'bf973405-3f2a-48d2-a687-2ed4167164be' -MemoryAt "2024-07-04 12:00:00"
```

Updates the memory's anchor date to July 4th, 2024 at noon.

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
Get-IMMemory | Where-Object IsSaved -eq $false | Set-IMMemory -IsSaved $true
```

Marks all unsaved memories as saved using pipeline processing.

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
Set-IMMemory -Id 'bf973405-3f2a-48d2-a687-2ed4167164be' -SeenAt (Get-Date)
```

Updates the memory's last seen timestamp to the current date and time.
