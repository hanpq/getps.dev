## SYNOPSIS

Retrieves map markers for assets with GPS coordinates.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Get-IMMapMarker [[-Session] <ImmichSession>] [[-CreatedAfter] <DateTime>] [[-CreatedBefore] <DateTime>]
 [[-IsArchived] <Boolean>] [[-IsFavorite] <Boolean>] [[-WithPartners] <Boolean>]
 [[-WithSharedAlbums] <Boolean>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The Get-IMMapMarker function retrieves map markers that represent the geographic
locations of assets in Immich.
Map markers are created from assets that contain
GPS metadata and provide a visual representation for map-based navigation and
asset discovery.

The function supports various filters to refine the returned markers based on
creation dates, archive status, favorites, partner sharing, and shared albums.
This enables targeted retrieval of location data for specific asset collections.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Get-IMMapMarker
```

Retrieves all available map markers for assets with GPS coordinates.

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
Get-IMMapMarker -IsFavorite $true
```

Retrieves map markers only for assets marked as favorites.

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
Get-IMMapMarker -CreatedAfter (Get-Date).AddMonths(-6) -IsArchived $false
```

Gets map markers for non-archived assets created in the last 6 months.

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
Get-IMMapMarker -WithPartners $true -WithSharedAlbums $true
```

Retrieves map markers including both partner-shared and shared album assets.
