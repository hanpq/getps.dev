## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new Immich library for asset management.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
New-IMLibrary [[-Session] <ImmichSession>] [-Name] <String> [[-ExclusionPatterns] <String[]>]
 [[-ImportPaths] <String[]>] [[-OwnerId] <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The New-IMLibrary function creates a new library in Immich for organizing and managing
digital assets.
Libraries define collections of assets with specific import paths,
exclusion patterns, and ownership settings.
Each library can monitor designated
directories and automatically import new assets according to configured rules.

Libraries provide a way to organize assets from different sources or with different
access requirements, such as personal photos, family albums, or professional archives.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
New-IMLibrary -Name 'Family Photos' -ImportPaths '/mnt/photos/family'
```

Creates a new library named 'Family Photos' that monitors the '/mnt/photos/family' directory.

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
New-IMLibrary -Name 'Professional Archive' -ImportPaths @('/storage/work', '/backup/projects') -ExclusionPatterns @('*.tmp', '.*')
```

Creates a library with multiple import paths and exclusion patterns for temporary and hidden files.

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
New-IMLibrary -Name 'User Collection' -ImportPaths '/home/user/pictures' -OwnerId 'bf973405-3f2a-48d2-a687-2ed4167164be'
```

Creates a library with a specific owner assigned by user ID.

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
$library = New-IMLibrary -Name 'Mobile Uploads' -ImportPaths '/uploads/mobile'
Write-Output "Created library: $($library.name) with ID: $($library.id)"
```

Creates a library and captures the returned library object for further processing.

## PARAMETERS

### -Session

Optionally define a immich session object to use.
This is useful when you are connected to more than one immich instance.

-Session $Session

```yaml
Type: ImmichSession
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None

Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None

help filter out unwanted files such as system files, temporary files, or specific
file types that should not be imported as assets.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 3
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

videos, and other supported media files.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 4
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
