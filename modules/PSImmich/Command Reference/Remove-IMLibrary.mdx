## SYNOPSIS

Removes an Immich library and all associated assets.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Remove-IMLibrary [[-Session] <ImmichSession>] [-id] <String[]> [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The Remove-IMLibrary function permanently deletes an Immich library along with all
its associated assets, metadata, and configuration settings.
This is a destructive
operation that cannot be undone, so it should be used with caution.

The function supports pipeline input for batch operations and includes confirmation
prompts to help prevent accidental deletions.
When a library is removed, all assets
within that library are also deleted from the Immich database, though the original
files on the file system remain unchanged.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Remove-IMLibrary -Id 'bf973405-3f2a-48d2-a687-2ed4167164be'
```

Removes the library with the specified ID after confirmation prompt.

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
Remove-IMLibrary -Id 'bf973405-3f2a-48d2-a687-2ed4167164be' -Confirm:$false
```

Removes the library without prompting for confirmation (use with extreme caution).

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
Get-IMLibrary | Where-Object Name -like '*test*' | Remove-IMLibrary
```

Removes all libraries with 'test' in their name using pipeline processing.

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
$librariesToRemove = @('bf973405-3f2a-48d2-a687-2ed4167164be', '9c4e0006-3a2b-4967-94b6-7e8bb8490a12')
$librariesToRemove | Remove-IMLibrary -WhatIf
```

Shows what would happen if the specified libraries were removed, without actually deleting them.
