## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new memory collection in Immich.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
New-IMMemory [[-Session] <ImmichSession>] [[-Year] <Int32>] [[-AssetIds] <String[]>] [-MemoryAt] <DateTime>
 [[-SeenAt] <DateTime>] [[-Type] <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The New-IMMemory function creates a new memory in Immich, which is a curated collection
of assets organized around a specific date, event, or theme.
Memories help users
rediscover their photos through temporal organization and can be configured for
different types of reminiscence experiences.

The function supports creating 'on_this_day' type memories that highlight assets
from previous years on the same date, helping users revisit past moments and experiences.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
New-IMMemory -MemoryAt "2024-01-01 00:00:00" -AssetIds 'bf973405-3f2a-48d2-a687-2ed4167164be', '9c4e0006-3a2b-4967-94b6-7e8bb8490a12'
```

Creates a New Year's Day memory for 2024 with two specific assets.

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
New-IMMemory -MemoryAt (Get-Date "2023-12-25") -Type 'on_this_day' -Year 2023
```

Creates a Christmas Day memory for 2023 using DateTime object for the date.

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
$assets = Get-IMAsset | Where-Object { $_.fileCreatedAt -like '*-07-04*' }
New-IMMemory -MemoryAt "2024-07-04" -AssetIds $assets.id
```

Creates a memory for July 4th using assets filtered by creation date.
