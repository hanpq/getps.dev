# What is pstools.daikin

This module provides cmdlets to manage a Daikin AirCon device. These devices is equiped with a network module that provides a REST API that can be used to query status information and set configuration. This API is not documented and this module is based on the findings by "ehjortberg" and the repo <https://github.com/ael-code/daikin-control>.

This is work in progress and currently only implements two cmdlets that retreive the status and a cmdlet to set mode and temperature.
