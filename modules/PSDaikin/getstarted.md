## About

This module provides cmdlets to manage a Daikin AirCon device. These devices is equiped with a network module that provides a REST API that can be used to query status information and set configuration. This API is not documented and this module is based on the findings by "ehjortberg" and the repo <https://github.com/ael-code/daikin-control>.

This is work in progress and currently only implements two cmdlets that retreive the status and a cmdlet to set mode and temperature.

## Installation

### PowerShell Gallery

To install from the PowerShell gallery using PowerShellGet run the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module PSDaikin -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Usage

### Retreive status of a daikin device

This cmdlet will try to retreive the general current status and configuration of the aircon device.

```powershell
Get-DaikinStatus -Hostname daikin.local.network
```
